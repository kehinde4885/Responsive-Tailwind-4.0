Remember Typography Scalling of Font Sizes when Planning

CONCEPT OF ELEMENTS and COMPONENTS
Multiple HTML Elements make up a UI Component,
When a component is used in multiple locations , its behaviour should be the same,
in other words the classes of the containers should be the same, only the content should change.
This is the concept of true reusable components.
-Look into StoryBook Framework for UI Prototyping

NOTES
-Trial and Error is the death of the development Process, it slows down everything, Proper planning is required 
for every level in web development
